Ace OS install scripts and makefile uses ACE_ROOT environment variable.
So set ACE_ROOT environment variable after extracting Ace source files.
It should point to base directory where Ace source files are copied.

Creating Image Files:
---------------------
	Run create_image.sh to create the image files required by the simulators.

	Setup grub in the created image file
	1) copy these lines into bochsrc file:
		floppya: image=raw.ima, status=inserted 
		floppyb: image=floppy.ima, status=inserted 
	2) Now run bochs and enter these commands from grub prompt.
		This will setup the floppy.ima to boot grub.
			root (fd1) 
			setup (fd1)
	3) Now floppy is set to boot from grub automatically.
		go to bochsrc and modify the lines to look like this:
			#floppya: image=raw.ima, status=inserted 
			floppya: image=floppy.ima, status=inserted
