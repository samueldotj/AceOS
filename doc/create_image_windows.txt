Creating floppy image files with GRUB installed

To create floppy/harddisk image file with GRUB 0.9x installed you need the following tools.

GRUB - (http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) (download GRUB Legacy binary)
FileDisk - (http://www.acc.umu.se/~bosse/)
Bochs - (http://bochs.sourceforge.net/)
NTRawrite - (http://ntrawrite.sourceforge.net/)

Extract/install all the above programs into appropriate folders and set PATH variable accordingly. The following steps assume you copied grub binaries into c:\test\grub. 

The following are the steps that I used to create GRUB floppy images.
"	Create RAW floppy image file
"	Write GRUB files in to the first sector of the image
"	Create FAT formatted floppy image file
"	Copy GRUB files to the image file
"	Boot using the first floppy image to write GRUB into the second floppy

Commands: 
#raw.ima - temporary grub disk. FAT.ima - Grub with FAT FS 
bximage -fd -q -size=1.44 raw.ima 
bximage -fd -q -size=1.44 FAT.ima 

#mount the images using filedisk 
filedisk /mount 0 c:\test\raw.ima 1.44M m: 
filedisk /mount 1 c:\test\FAT.ima 1.44M n: 

#create temp grub disk in raw format 
copy /b  grub\stage1+grub\stage2 grub.raw 
ntrawrite -f grub.raw -d m: 

#prepare the second disk with GRUB files and directory structure 
format /fs:FAT n: 
mkdir n:\grub 
copy grub\stage1 n:\grub 
copy grub\stage2 n:\grub 

#copy your kernel - the name may be anything
copy kernel.sys n:\ 

#all done - unmount the disks 
filedisk /umount m: 
filedisk /umount n: 

Replace the c:\test with your directory path.

Installing GRUB
Now we have two floppy images - raw.ima can boot however without any file system and FAT.ima with FAT file system but without GRUB. The following steps will install GRUB in the FAT.ima. 
Modify your bochsrc file to include two floppy images. Also set your emulator to boot from floppy.
floppya: image=raw.ima, status=inserted 
floppyb: image=FAT.ima, status=inserted 

If you are using QEmu or other emulator use the appropriate option to include the both floppy images and the order should be same - floppy a = raw.ima and floppy b = FAT.ima

Now run the emulator and type the following command in the grub prompt 
root (fd1) 
setup (fd1) 

This will install GRUB in the FAT.ima

Starting Kernel
Modify your bochsrc file again to include only the FAT.ima(remove raw.ima)
floppya: image=FAT.ima, status=inserted 

After booting type the following command. If your kernel is multiboot compatible it will boot.
kernel /kernel.sys 
boot 

Misc
We don't need the raw.ima so ou may delete it.
del raw.ima

To make the development easier you can use FileDisk in your makefile to insert your kernel after successful compilation. To do so you may insert the following command in your makefile

filedisk /mount 0 c:\test\FAT.ima 1.44M n: 
copy kernel.sys n:\ 
filedisk /umount n: 

Also you can create menu.lst file in the boot\grub directory in the floppy image to automatically boot your kernel.

default 0
timeout 1
title My Kernel
kernel /kernel.sys
boot
